	IS NP-Hard:
		-...


	Approximation Algs:
		-run in polynomial time and
		-garuanteed that it gives some answer that is a given factor off from the optimal answer
		-approximation ratio of alg A:
			Alpha_A = max (A(I)/Opt(I))
		-goal of finding solution with lowest approximation ratio
		

		Minimization-VC
			Alg A:
			-pick edges disjoint from those already chosen
			-stop when no more canbe chosen
			-select endpoints of each of those vertices to create vertex cover

		Proof:
			-matching-subset of edgew w/ no common vertices
			-maximal matching - no more edges can be added
			-and VC in G >= # of edges in any matching in G
			-S must be a vertex cover
				-if not, There is an edge e not covered, this implies M is not maximal and our algorithm would'n't have stopped
			-S has 2|M| vertices 
				-VC >= any |M|, |S| = 2|M| vertices
					-Alpha_a <= (2|M|/|M|) implies Alpha_a <= 2
