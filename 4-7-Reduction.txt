Outline:
	-Reduction
	-Duality



	Reduction:
		-Variables: f_e for all e (edge) in E (Edge set)	
		-maximize the sum of all flows from s to v  (source to vertex)
		-subject to: 
			f_e <+ c_e for all e in E
		

		-feasible
			feasible
				-show that feasible region is not empty
				-set all flows equal to zero
			bounded
				-show upper bound on optimization function
			optimal 
				-optimal LP Value = solution to maxflow
				-argue correctness of optimization function, constraints


	Duality:
		-certificate of optimality
			-like max-flow/min-cut
		-any linear max problem has dual min problem


		max X_1 + 6X_2
	subject to:
		1- X_1 <= 2--
		2- X_2<= 300
		3- X_1+X_2 <= 400
		   X_1, X_2 >= 0

	Answer: X_1 = 100
		  X_2 = 300
	Optimal val: 1,900

		6 * (2) 6X_2 <= 1800
		    (1) X_1 <= 200
		X_1 + 6X_2 <= 2000

			Duality Theorem:
				-If a linear program has a bounded optimum, then do does its dual and the two optimal values coincide
				-duality gap is zero
